            <h3>About AFC Leopards SC - Kayole Branch</h3>
            <!--<h3>Voluptatem dignissimos provident quasi corporis voluptates sit assum perenda sruen jonee trave</h3>-->
          
          <div class="col-lg-8">
            <p>
              <pre>
In 2011 when Afc Leopards SC was changing its constitution to recognize the contribution
of the fans towards the growth of the club, few individuals sat down over a cup of tea to lay
down strategies of building a branch. It was James Mandare, Bethwel Mulamula, Alex
Ajanga, Mark Atenya, Stanzo Angila who were behind the formation of the now Kayole
Branch.

They ensured the branch is in place with Stanzo becoming the first chairman and James
Mandare the Secretary General. They made sure Kayole Branch was the first Branch to be
registered with our National Office.

They mobilized members to join the Branch in large numbers. At first lack of resources
hindered the smooth running of the branch but it was dealt with after setting mechanism of
mobilizing more members to come on board.

The love of the club saw members come in to register in large numbers. Meeting places
were a headache until they approached one of the owners of a certain club at Masimba,
Kayole {Pewa} for a space which he accepted.

Donning a blue and white Afc jersey was the swag in the estate due to the pride that was
associated with telling a friend about the branch. In the books of history Kayole branch
stands out as the Branch that came up with the travelling fans initiative which was adopted
by other branches.

In the process Kayole Branch became a household name in the circles of Afc Leopards SC
family. The Branch was among the leading team that spearheaded contribution towards
purchasing the precious Team bus. The Branch Members were also at the forefront in
helping in drafting the new constitution. Ingwe funfest and many other activities were
championed by members of Kayole Branch. Over the years the Branch has grown in
numbers with some members going ahead and establishing new Branches such as Bunyore
Branch, Kayole Chapter Branch, Mowlem Branch and Umoja III Branch.

The Branch has seen the change in guard in the main office which has contributed
immensely for the growth of the club. Our pioneer chairman struggled through thick and
thin to see, peace and tranquillity prevails in the branch.
The Branch has seen many peaceful elections taking place but our office remained the same
and united. Having proper structures in place, the Branch has come in handy assisting
members in times of need, stepping in times of tribulations and keeping in the
brotherhood/sisterhood.

The days our club was facing financial turbulence, our members in, Rose osore (Maty
continue resting in peace), Marion mugivane, Gilbert Selebwa spearhead the 1k initiative
thus paying up players allowances. Kayole is on record of hosting and housing some players
during that time such as Ngama, Dialo among others.

In the 2016 Elections Eastland’s Finest as as normally referred to, produced two candidates
to vie for respective positions in the main office. Our pioneer chairman Stanzo Elijah
Omungala and one Gilbert Selebwa went for Assistant secretary/Organizing secretaries’
positions. Proudly our candidate Stanzo won the seat with a big margin with Selebwa
missing it narrowly. Our numbers grew thrice unlike the numbers which voted during the
era of Mr.Allain Kasavuli which was a great achievement in the history of the branch.
As our club’s constitution states about elections, after the national office and branch follows,
we observed it to the latter by holding our elections. For the first time we had a stiff
completion regarding the chairmanship of the branch. Two strong candidates came forth for
the position. James Mandare and Erick Alusa contested. Erick was declared a winner taking
over from Stanzo for the position of the chairman of the branch. The Number of registered
voters were 101 with 63 members voting through secret ballot. For the first time we
witnessed change of guard with a very organized system.

The branch has set its goals in achieving to be the Eastland’s finest by travelling in flashy
vehicles, uniting, and sorting issues amicably. Kayole has a running football tea, a registered
Self-Help Group (Welfare) which makes members bond and come together as social beings
that we are.

Members have been funding all the Branch activities. It has featured in social activities such
as CSR, Ingwe fans funfest etc with great achievements. The Branch is focused on improving
the social and economic status of its members and the club as well as impacting the
community. As the history has it Kayole Branch is the mother of all branches and the Branch
to emulate, associate with as well as learn from.
As our slogan goes, Together we Stand, Together we Achieve” The leadership of the Branch
will forever tasked to work for the interest of members and our Team AFC Leopards SC.</pre>
